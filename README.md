●	What did you like about this project?
I wouldn't say like but it makes me realise the scale of coding. I'm stress and mad and piss off but I know I haven't put in all the time to study and revise. I cannot do anything else but to focus 100% on HTML, CSS and subsequently, JavaScript. 

●	What did you struggle with in this project?
All the concepts. I don't know how to align the grid or boxes or whatever it is called. Cannot get it right. I cannot implement my codes correctly. I change one side, another side also changes. 

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Just gonna study and understand to make it work. Need to understand completely, each and every basic concept. If I don't understand, I'll always get stuck. I don't know how much time I need to fully grasp what I needed to understand.
